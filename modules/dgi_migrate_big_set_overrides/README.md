# DGI Migrate Big Set Overrides

## Introduction

Big Set Overrides assists in extremely large migrations, which would typically see site slowdown and frequent failure. This module aims to reduce both of those. As such, it should only be enabled for the duration of a migration and is not recommended to be kept on otherwise.

## Features

Big Set Overrides is responsible for doing a few main things:

1. Disables the `repository_item_content_sync_helper_export` context so that `content_sync` doesn't export any nodes during the migration.
2. Disables the `repository_item_media_content_sync_helper_export` context so that `content_sync` doesn't export any media during the migration.
3. Disables the default Solr index, so items are not immediately indexed upon ingest.
4. Disables the `path_alias` title generation.
5. Unsets these `content_sync` hook implementations when present so
   `content_sync` doesn't continuously track entities during the migration:
   * `entity_update`
   * `entity_insert`
   * `entity_delete`
