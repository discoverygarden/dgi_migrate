  # XXX: Work around issue with interactions of entity hooks and migrations:
  # Context reactions firing from entity hooks could try minting a value when
  # stub entities are ingested; however, the non-stub migration:
  # - might want to provide a value; or,
  # - might be left blank, expecting the main migration to mint a value;
  #   however, the destination plugin would delete the value minted on the stub
  #   when processing an empty value, resulting in attempting to mint again but
  #   now failing with HTTP 409s as the Handle was already allocated when the
  #   stub was ingested.
