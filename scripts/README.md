# Migration Helpers

## Setup

1. Prepare a logging directory (later referenced as `LOG_DIR`), owned by the user who will be running the
   migration.
2. Copy `env.sample` to `$LOG_DIR/.env`.
3. Edit `$LOG_DIR/.env` appropriately, at minimum:
    * Add a `URI` entry for the target site.
    * Add the `MIGRATION_GROUP` to be processed.

### Tracking down drush

For convenience, we use `drush` to find the path of the module under which the
scripts are installed, but so need to know where `drush` is such that it can be
called. There may not always be a nice way to do this... if on the `PATH`, you
should be able to refer to it with something like:

```bash
DRUSH=$(which drush)
```

... however, if _not_ on the `PATH`, it might have to be explicitly provided in
a manner much the same as it is calculated and used _inside_ of our scripts,
with a reference relative to Drupal's root directory.

```bash
# Usual default location.
DRUPAL_ROOT=/opt/www/drupal
DRUSH="$DRUPAL_ROOT/vendor/bin/drush"
```

## Usage

### Import

If additional parameters/options need to be passed to the `dgi-migrate:import`
call (see `drush dgi-migrate:import --help` for a list of what there is;
however not everything is supported, such as `feedback` (which should be
silently ignored)), they can be added to the end of the command:

```bash
sudo bash $($DRUSH dd dgi_migrate)/scripts/migration.sh $LOG_DIR
```

When finished, the output should look like:

```
[... lots of verbose output of which we do not care to discuss at the moment ...]
+ set +x
---
Import command (operation 14) terminated; see log files in:
- /tmp/asdf/14-import.log
- /tmp/asdf/14-run.log
and the JSON files representing the output messages in:
- /tmp/asdf/14-messages
```

... at the bottom of the given `*-import.log` file, you should see details
regarding the timing (and success) of the command, for example:

```
$ tail -n 23 /tmp/asdf/14-import.log
	Command being timed: "/opt/www/drupal/vendor/bin/drush dgi-migrate:import --root=/opt/www/drupal --uri=http://adam-i9manage-dev-imt-92.dev.dgi --user=1 --group=isi__alpha"

```

#### Multiprocessing

The default processing will be single-threaded; however, we have built out mechanisms to allow for migrations to be multiprocessed. This mechanism will be activated by `PROCESSES` in the `.env` having a value greater than `1`. When greater than `1`, for each migration being executed our migration processing will:

1. Populate a queue in one command, initializing the migration (change the "migration state" to "running")
2. Spawn `PROCESSES` processes to process the queue
3. ... wait for the spawned processes to exit (ideally, having finished processing)
4. And finally tear-down the queue, and finalize the migration (set the "migration state" back to "idle").

The primary means of encountering race conditions has also been adjusted to attempt to serialize lookup/creation, which is to say, in generating entities via `migration_lookup` stubbing.

Our `migration.sh` script should handle setting the `DGI_MIGRATE__DO_MIGRATION_LOOKUP_LOCKING` variable to the string `TRUE`, which will enable the given locking behaviour.

NOTE: For small sets being migrated, it is likely that the overhead of multiprocessing may out weight the benefits. Initial guesstimate is around a-handful-of-tens to hundreds of items where multiprocessing might become advantageous.

NOTE: In terms of establishing the `PROCESSES` quantity, there are environmental considerations:
* Multiprocessing is just to optimize CPU usage; for example, to avoid having CPUs sit unnecessarily idle when there's work to be done.
* Is Crayfish on the same machine? Are derivatives enabled? There can be additional load from Crayfish acquiring files from Drupal, or if on the same machine, from the derivatives proper being run.
* Is the site being used by others? If so, it is probably a good idea to play nice and to try to avoid saturating the CPUs, perhaps going so far as to `nice` the migration execution. If not, we could target a slight bit of oversaturation, with the expectation that there will be some background I/O overhead on read/write operations that might leave some CPU cycles otherwise unoccupied.

#### Locking plugins

The means of locking is pluggable. The default implementation uses a directory of locks for various purposes in `temporary://`, using [PHP's `\SplFileInfo::flock()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/splfileobject.flock.php), in [our `flock` plugin](../src/Plugin/dgi_migrate/locker/Flock.php); this `flock` plugin _does_ requires the ability to open many files (on the orders of tens-of-thousands). We also provide [a `pgsql_advisory_locking` plugin](../src/Plugin/dgi_migrate/locker/PgsqlAdvisoryLocking.php) that might be used to perform locking using [a PostgreSQL database's advisory locking capabilities](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADVISORY-LOCKS); however, it is expected that using such might perform somewhat slower than `flock` due to requiring the round-trips to the DB. Ideally, we should look at implementing native semaphore/mutex functionality.

The locking plugin can be:
- configured by setting the `DGI_MIGRATE_DEFAULT_LOCKER` to the ID of the desired plugin
  - Built-in are `flock` and `pgsql_advisory_locking`; however, other modules might provide other plugins
- configured for on the particular migration lookup plugin definition, via the `locker` property.

### Rollback

If additional parameters/options need to be passed to the `dgi-migrate:rollback`
call, (see `drush dgi-migrate:rollback --help` for a list of what there is;
however, not everything is necessarily supported) they can be added to the end of
the command. The example base command might look something like:

```bash
sudo bash $($DRUSH dd dgi_migrate)/scripts/rollback.sh $LOG_DIR
```

... of particular interest here might be the `--statuses` options, which can be:

> An optional set of row statuses, comma-separated, to which to constrain the
rollback. Valid states are: "imported", "needs_update", "ignored", and "failed".

... to be able to rollback things that are in the `ignored` and `failed` states,
fix up whatever was causing them to fail/be ignored, and then kick off the
migration again is a very useful pattern of execution to iterate towards
convergence.

When finished, the output should look like:

```
+ set +x
---
Rollback command (operation 15) terminated; see log files in:
- /tmp/asdf/15-rollback.log
- /tmp/asdf/15-run.log
```

... at the bottom of the given `*-rollback.log` file, you should see details
regarding the timing (and success of the command, for example:

```
$ tail -n23 /tmp/asdf/15-rollback.log
	Command being timed: "/opt/www/drupal/vendor/bin/drush dgi-migrate:rollback --root=/opt/www/drupal --uri=http://adam-i9manage-dev-imt-92.dev.dgi --user=1 --group=isi__alpha"

## Double Models

The provided script, `double_model.sh` will perform a naive analysis on a FOXML object store. FOXML objects with two models defined in their `RELS-EXT` will silently fail the migration.

This script requires the `RELS-EXT` to be managed (and not base 64 encoded) for it to work. It's recommended to redirect the output to a file.

Example:

```
sudo bash $($DRUSH dd dgi_migrate)/scripts/double_model.sh /mnt/objectStore > models
```
